# Facial Keypoint Detection

Did this project as part of the requirements for graduation of the Udacity Computer Vision Nanodegree program. Defined and Trained and CNN on facial keypoint dataset from " YouTube Faces Dataset" using custom transformation in PyTorch to perform regression task to predict the location of 68 facial keypoints. During inference detected all the faces in an image using OpenCV's pre-trained Haar Cascade classifiers and predicted the location of 68 facial keypoints on those detected faces using our trained CNN network.
